# WPE Manager

## What is it? 

This is a set of scripts that will give us insight into what's going on within our account at WP Engine. 

## What does it do? 

It uses the [WP Engine API](https://wpengineapi.com/reference) , strips out all the useless UI/Chrome of the my.wpengine.com control panel and gives us things we need
to know about at WP Engine. 



## Examples 

1. Show me a list of all the sites I have hosted at WP Engine
1. Show me details of a site 
1. Show me a list of WP install
1. Show me details of an install 



### Install Notes

We're not using the latest version of Guzzle as it conflicts with Google API Client library
